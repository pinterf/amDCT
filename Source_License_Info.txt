The following software and documentation is contained in the amDCT package.

1: The software of the original research upon which the SmoothD, SmoothD2, and amDCT dlls are based is in   
       "SmoothD2\CodeCopiedFrom_OriginalSources\SmoothD009pre2_src\source from orig paper"
   The file README.IJG in that directory contains license information for some code used 
   in the research paper code.  It seems to be a simple open source license.

2: The excellent paper

      Enhancement of JPEG-Compressed Images by
      Re-application of JPEG
      Aria Nosratinia (aria@utdallas.edu)
      Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson,
      TX 75083

   which describes the algorithm of the original research is in the file "JPEG resampling paper.pdf" in
      "amDCT\documentation"
   is well worth studing. It carries no explicit copyright that I saw.

 
3: The software for SmoothD in
       "amDCT\CodeCopiedFrom_OriginalSources\SmoothD009pre2_src"
   Has no explicit copyright information that I saw.
   The manual page at http://www.funknmary.de/bergdichter/projekte/video/SmoothD/ 
   which links to the source code download has the following copyright notice

      Version 0.0.9pre2 November 8th, 2004

   Thank you Tobias Bergmann.  Without your code as a guide I would never started working
   on SmoothD2.  I really only intended to fix the bug that kept me from being able to
   call SmoothD more then once.  Then I started to see lots of different things I could
   do.  Most of them were worthless but by the time I found that out I had done a fairly
   major rewrite.

10: Code from Ivan Kuckir's blog,  http://blog.ivank.net  which had the following on it.
                       "All code that you see at this blog is free to use, under MIT licence."

     Thank you Ivan Kuckir for making your code available and for your explanations of how it works.

     I translated fastest-gaussian-blur into C from the javascript code 
	and modified the center weight function to better suit the needs of amDCT.


  

NOTE:  I have included items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in this package for the following reasons.

	1. To provide some historical background to the code.
	2. To acknowledge that work.
	3. Because I hate having to track down papers and software that may no longer 
           reside on the web.  People move, domains change, etc.
